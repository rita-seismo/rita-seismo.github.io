                <h3>The Development of Rifting and Hotspot Tectonism</h3>
                <p> Precisely how continental plates rift apart to form new oceans is debated because there 
                    are few places on Earth where this process is currently active. One such region is the 3000 km-long 
                    East African Rift, where narrow rift valleys cut through the uplifted Ethiopian and Kenyan Plateaus – 
                    the highest topographical points on the African continent. This project focuses on an intriguing and 
                    largely unexplored segment of the rift – the Turkana Depression. This region stands out in East Africa 
                    due to its unusual breadth, low elevation, and unique history as the host of a previous failed rift 
                    system through which the East African Rift subsequently developed. The Turkana Rift Investigating 
                    Lithospheric Structure (TRAILS) project was set-up to investigate the crustal and mantle seismic 
                    structure in the Depression.

                <h3>Terminal-Stage Subduction Processes</h3>
                <p> After protracted subduction, slabs ultimately detach and sink into the deep mantle, however the exact 
                    processes at play are debated. The Eastern Mediterranean is a unique natural laboratory for terminal 
                    subduction processes because it captures the transition from subduction of Earth's oldest oceanic lithosphere 
                    in the west (below the Aegean), to collision-dominated convergence in the east (below eastern Anatolia). 
                    Using the seismograms of distant earthquakes, we tomographically image mantle structure across the eastern 
                    Mediterranean, illuminating an increasingly fragmenting slab and delaimated lithosphere from the overriding
                    plate. Asthenospheric flow through slab gaps and a thinned Anatolian lithosphere both contribute
                    to volcanism and and uplift across the entire region.

                <h3>Mantle Flow at Subduction Zones </h3>
                <p> Shear-wave splitting measurements of seismic anisotropy at seismograph stations provide valuable insights into dominant 
                    lithospheric fabrics and asthenospheric flow beneath a region. Applying this technique to the Alaskan Subduction Margin, 
                    we find that variations in slab geometry control the azimuth and strength of the anisotropy, suggesting slab geometry plays
                     a primary role in controlling mantle flow. Near the slab edge, highly variable anisotropic fast directions also strongly
                     indicate the presence of torroidal flow.

                <h3>Absolute Arrival-Time Tomography </h3>
                <p> In this project, we developed P-wave tomographic models of the mantle below the entire African continent using absolute arrival-times.
                    We used these models to explore the modification of cratonic lithosphere and the architecture of mantle plumes below
                    East Africa.

                <h3>Imaging the Lithosphere Below Copper-Rich Basins </h3>
                <p> The Copper Basin Exploration Science (CuBES) project involved the deployment of a 35-station broadband
                    seismograph netowork to investigate the tectonic development of Central Africa - a region rich in critical 
                    metal deposits (e.g., Copper, Nickel and Cobalt). Using passive seismological data recorded over an 
                    18-month period, we image crustal and mantle structure using a variety of seismological techniques to 
                    constrain the region's tectonic evolution.

                <h3>Geothermal Energy </h3>
                <p> Hydrothermal fluids often found in continental rifts have fantastic potential to provide a 
                    reliable source of geothermal power to local communities. In these regions, recordings from 
                    seismograph stations often reveal earthquake swarms that accompany rock fractures during 
                    fluid migration. Monitoring seismicity is thus proven to be a powerful tool for 
                    understanding the behaviour of geothermal systems. In one of Zambia's most promising geothermal 
                    systems, we have utilized passive seismological deployments, using novel MEMS-based seismic nodes
                    to monitor seismicity, map permeable fracture networks, and characterize the tectonic stresses 
                    shaping the region.
